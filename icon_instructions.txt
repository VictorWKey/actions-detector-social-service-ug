# Icon configuration for the GUI application
# Since we can't create binary files through text, here are instructions:

# To add an icon to the application:
# 1. Create or download a 32x32 pixel PNG/ICO file named "app_icon.ico"
# 2. Place it in the same directory as gui_main.py
# 3. Uncomment the following line in gui_main.py in the __init__ method:
#    self.root.iconbitmap('app_icon.ico')

# Alternative: Use emoji as window title (already implemented)
# The ðŸš€ emoji in the title serves as a visual identifier

# For a professional deployment, consider:
# - Converting the emoji to an actual icon file
# - Using tools like GIMP or online converters
# - Creating multiple sizes (16x16, 32x32, 48x48) for different contexts
